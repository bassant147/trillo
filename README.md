It's a fictional all-in-one booking app. The user can book a hotel, a flight, a car and a tour all in one platform. The main focus was on the design aspects and using Sass and flexbox. So, there's no functionality really, the focus was on the user interface. 

## Built with:
* HTML5, CSS3 and Sass

### Worked with:
* SVG images
* Flexbox layout
* Advanced CSS animations with @keyframes, animation and transition;
* Advanced CSS selectors, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements required for modern CSS development;
* Sass: variables, nesting, partials, imports, mixins, functions, extends, and more;
* Setting global variables, building for reusability, architecting CSS and managing media queries;
